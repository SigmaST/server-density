Increase uptime by spotting negative trends in your data. Create and customise multiple views with different metrics, layouts and widgets.

Graph anything against anything and watch how things change over time. Build an understanding of what's normalâ€¦ so you know when things aren't as normal.
- Elastic Graphs Widget<br/>
Plot all the metrics for devices or services matching a search term. This means we'll automagically display new devices and / or remove old ones for you. You're welcome.
- Alerts Widget<br/>
Alerts tend to need fixing - don't lose track of them. Our alerts widget allows you to see aggregated alerts for devices, groups or your entire infrastructure.
- Service Status Widget<br/>
Get an up to date feed of the status of your services from over 25 locations around the world. Is your website up? Is is loading quickly for your customers in Iceland?
- Cloud Status Widget<br/>
If things look like they're going wrong, you'll want to know about problems with your hosting provider. Get RSS feeds on the service status of the Cloud provider of choice.
